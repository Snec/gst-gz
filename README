# zlib based GStreamer plugins

This project provides GStreamer plugins in order to compress and decompress data with zlib.
Two plugins are provided:
	* gzenc: plugin for compressing data.
	* gzdec: plugin for decompressing data.
Two formats are supported for now:
	* zlib compressed format (RFC 1950).
	* gzip compressed format (RFC 1952).

GStreamer 1.0 and 0.10 are both supported. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

These plugins have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04

You should install those dependencies:
```
sudo apt install gstreamer0.10-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-base zlib1g-dev
```

### Installing

Clone the git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Snec/gst-gz.git
```

Build and install the plugins:
```
cd gz
./autogen.sh
./configure --with-gstreamer-api=1.0
make
sudo make install
```

You can choose which GStreamer version to use with the `--with-gstreamer-api` option. (--with-gstreamer-api=0.10 to use GStreamer 0.10)

## Running tests on plugins

```
echo "This is a test ..." > file.txt 
GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0 gst-launch-1.0 -v filesrc location=file.txt ! gzenc ! filesink location=file.txt.gz
GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0 gst-launch-1.0 -v filesrc location=file.txt.gz ! gzdec ! filesink location=file_dec.txt
if cmp -s "file.txt" "file_dec.txt"; then echo "Test failed"; else echo "Test succed"; fi
```

### Todo
Add support for deflate compressed format (RFC 1951)
